			What have I been up to?  Over the past twelve years I have worked at the very core of Image
			Publications. I joined to work on their men's magazine, <b>himself</b>, in 1997 and worked though all 
			the issues related with a start-up. From there I was promoted to Art Director of <a href="http://www.image.ie">IMAGE</a>, one of 
			Irelands leading glossy women’s titles. I was involved in the initial rebrand in 1999 and a 
			implemented a complete rebrand in 2008, bringing it to a level at which it can compete with any 
			international magazine on the shelves today. I was also responsible for developing all new titles, 
			giving them a separate identity while at the same time maintaining house style. Products included 
			in this work were <b>Health</b>, a stand alone health magazine (very ambiguous title, wasn't it), <b>Image 
			Parenting</b>, <b>Weddings</b>, <b>Image Interiors</b> and <b>Business</b>. I also had the opportunity to be involved in 
			<b>Great Irish Houses</b>, a large format coffee table book produced in 2008. In 2007 my work was recognised 
			by the industry when they awarded me for my efforts with a lovely glass trophy. (It makes a nice 
			paperweight). While at Image I designed quite a few magazines freelance for other publishing houses, 
			and one newspaper. I was also involved in several start-ups, aiding them in structuring their work, 
			IT, budgets and scheduling as well as quality control and dealing with printers. My involvement in 
			business development of the groups’ portfolio has given me a finely balanced understanding of how 
			the needs of the reader can be balanced with those of the advertiser. I always work in constant 
			consultation with the relevant editorial and ad teams, in order to assure buy-in and understanding 
			and to achieve the highest possible level of design. Current projects include the <b>Weekend</b> magazine 
			and covers of <b>Day &amp; Night</b> for the Independent Newspaper group, I had previously designed their 
			Christmas magazine <b>Mistletoe</b>, and ongoing advertising work for <a href="http://www.clarins.com">Clarins</a> cosmetic company.
